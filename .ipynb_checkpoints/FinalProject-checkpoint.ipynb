    "Counterstrike: Global Offensive (CS:GO) is a 5 vs 5 multiplayer online shooter where there are two teams: terrorists and counter terrorists. The goal of the terrorists are to detonate and explosive device and the goal of the counter terrorists is to stop the terrorists from detonating the device. The terrorists win a round by either eliminating all counter terrorists or sucessfully planting and detonating the device before a pre set timer runs out. the counter terrorists win a round by either eliminating all terrorists before the device is planted, or defusing the explosive device."
